My mom, the original Ms. P, passed away from congestive heart failure in 2009 at the age of 60. Then in 2018, my middle sister passed away from a heart attack at 51. This curse of early death had to be defeated. I shifted to a gluten-free diet in 2009, and would have loved to assist my sister before she passed in 2018.
